# React Portfolio

This application is my refactored portfolio using React to showcase my recent work and contact information.

In this application I accomplished the following:

1. On load, the user is presented with a page containing a header, content section and a footer. On initial load, the user is brought to the About Me section containing my profile photo and short bio.

2. Within the header, the user can find my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume). The title corresponding to the current active section is bold and emphasized in a different color.

3. When the user clicks on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section content below the navigation without the page reloading.

4. When the user clicks on the Portfolio section, they are prseented with six titled images of my recent development work. Each card contains an image, title, description and links to both the deployed application (or walkthrough video if it is a command-line application) and the Github repository.

5. When the user clicks on the Contact section, they are presented with a contact form containing fields for name, email address and message. If the user enters an invalid email address and tries to submit the form, they are presented with a notice indicating that the email format is incorrect.

6. When the user clicks on the Resume section, they can either click the button to download my resume as a PDF, or view my proficiencies right on the page.

7. Within the footer, the user can find icons linking to my corresponding pages for Github, LinkedIn and Stack Overflow.
